# Biostatistics

This repository contains latex codes for the materials used in my course *Biostatistics* at National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.  The course is intended for first-year post-baccalaureate medical students.  If you are only interested in accessing the book but not the latex code, navigate to the **pdf** folder.
